# JKLU Fraternity Network

**Contributions are to be made in contributions folder only.**
---
The year 2020 went really fast, just a blink of eye and here we are, in the month of October. 
The auspicious month for OpenSource enthusiasts around the world and the time for one of the biggest open source celebrations: [HacktoberFest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

This year has really driven us apart by barring us into our homes. But it's time to connect together (of course virtually). 

This time we present to you a webapp dedicated to JKLU students and Open source. 
Are you the most popular student/faculty/staff member at JKLU? If yes, here is your chance to prove it.

One pull request lands you to our Network Graph where you can flaunt how strong your network is and 4 pull requests to a limited edition T-shirt or a chance to plant a tree. We are here to take care of our environment as well as open source.

So what are you waiting for Oh!! how to make a pull request. Don't worry we are here to help you out.
Go ahead and check out the contributions folder, where you will find the instructions about making your first (or possibly 100th) pull request.

Just two simple steps will lend you the graph and closer to the limited edition T-shirt that you have been eyeing since the start of the month.
You can make a better hold over the T-shirt by making even more PR to this project on any other open source repository participating in the event. You will be part of a network graph something like this:

### TL;DR
Fill up the form at the webapp (link is in about section). Then come here, make a pull request in the contributions folder. The contributions are open for everyone and not just coders. You can contribute using anything, be it an artistic project, be it a case study or be a "Hello World" program. Go nuts! and display your talent to the world. Head to the folder for more information about how to make the pull request. Contributions are welcomed from both JKLUians or non-JKLUians but one needs to fill up the form at the website to be part of the Network Graph.

## Advanced Stuff:
Don't worry if some lines below feel gibberish to you. You need not to read this to contribute and become an open source enthusiast. The above content is fine to start. Oh, you have decided to stick with us, that's great. Let's dive in then.

We welcome contributions to the project apart from the contributions made in the contribution folder.
